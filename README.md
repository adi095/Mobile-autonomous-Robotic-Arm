#**Mobile Manipulation with KUKA youBot (Capstone Project)**
This project is part of the **Modern Robotics Specialization**, focusing on **mobile manipulation**. The objective is to develop software to control a **KUKA youBot** â€” a mobile robot with an omnidirectional **mecanum-wheel base** and a **5-joint robotic arm** â€” to perform **pick-and-place tasks** in a simulated environment using **MATLAB** and the **V-REP simulator**.

##**Project Overview**
The project integrates several key robotics concepts:
- **Mobile base control** using **odometry** for precise navigation
- **Trajectory planning** for the robot arm to move objects between designated locations
- **Feedback control** to ensure accuracy and stability in movement

The system is tested in the **V-REP (Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform)** simulator, allowing for realistic interaction with a virtual environment.

## **Key Features**
- **Simultaneous control** of the mobile base and robotic arm
- **Trajectory planning** using kinematics for pick-and-place tasks
- **Odometry implementation** for accurate mobile navigation
- **Feedback control** for precise motion execution
- Utilizes **MATLAB** and the **Modern Robotics software library**
